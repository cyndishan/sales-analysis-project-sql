# üìä Sales Performance Analysis (SQL & PowerBI Project)

## üß† Project Overview

This project analyzes a bicycle retail company's sales data using SQL to uncover trends and performance patterns across stores, time, and products. The goal is to generate insights that can support decision-making for marketing and sales strategies.

## üìÇÔ∏è Dataset

- Name: Retail Sales DatasetSource: Kaggle - [Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database)

- Table names: Brands, Categories, Customers, Order_items, Orders, Products, Staffs, Stocks, Stores

## üîß Tools Used

- SQL: For querying and analysis

- DBMS: MySQL 

- PowerBI for visualization

## üìå Methodology

- Created a new MySQL database to store and organize data from multiple CSV files.

- Defined relational tables based on the dataset structure, ensuring primary and foreign key relationships were established.

- Imported data into MySQL using the Table Data Import Wizard in MySQL Workbench for each table (e.g., Brands, Categories, Stores, etc.).

- Wrote and executed SQL queries to explore key areas such as:

  Total and monthly sales performance

  Best-selling products and categories  

- Used PowerBI to create interactive visualizations.
  
- Embedded charts and summarized findings in this README.md to effectively communicate data insights.

- Demonstrated the full cycle of data analysis ‚Äî from importing raw data to generating insights and visuals for storytelling.

## üìå Key Insights

- üè¨ Baldwin Bikes outperformed the other two stores with a total sales figure of $5.2 million between 2016 and 2018.

- üö≤ The best-selling product was Trek Slash 8 27.5, generating $560K in 2016 alone.

- üìâ Sales trends for all the stores followed a similar pattern:

 1. A rise in sales from 2016 to 2017

 2. A consistent decline from 2017 to the end of 2018, falling below 2016 levels

- ü•á The top-performing product categories were:

 1. Mountain Bikes ‚Äì $2.7 million

 2. Road Bikes ‚Äì $1.7 million

 3. Cruisers Bicycles ‚Äì $1.0 million

## ‚úÖ Actionable Suggestions

üîç Investigate the sales decline in 2018, especially for Baldwin and Santa Cruz stores. Analyze internal and external factors like pricing, customer satisfaction, or market competition.

üéØ Focus future marketing and inventory on top-performing categories like Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes to maximize return.

üõí Restock and promote best-sellers such as the Trek Slash 8 27.5, or explore product updates to reignite sales.

üìÜ Consider launching seasonal or Q4 campaigns, as early trends suggest stronger year-end performance.
