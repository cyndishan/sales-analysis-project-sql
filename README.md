# üìä Sales Performance Analysis (SQL & Python Project)

## üß† Project Overview

This project analyzes a fictional retail company's sales data using SQL to uncover trends and performance patterns across time, products, and customer segments. The goal is to generate insights that can support decision-making for marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

## üìÇÔ∏è Dataset

- Name: Retail Sales DatasetSource: Kaggle - Sales Dataset:

- Table names: Brands, Categories, Customers, Order_items, Orders, Products, Staffs, Stocks, Stores

## üîß Tools Used

- SQL: For querying and analysis

- DBMS: MySQL 

- Python for visualization

## üìå Methodology

- Created a new MySQL database to store and organize data from multiple CSV files.

- Defined relational tables based on the dataset structure, ensuring primary and foreign key relationships were established.

- Imported data into MySQL using the Table Data Import Wizard in MySQL Workbench for each table (e.g., Customers, Orders, Products, etc.).

- Wrote and executed SQL queries to explore key areas such as:

  Total and monthly sales performance

  Best-selling products and categories

  Store-wise revenue comparison

  Customer purchase behavior

- Used Python to create clear and simple visualizations (bar charts, line graphs) from query results.

- Embedded charts and summarized findings in this README.md to effectively communicate data insights.

- Demonstrated the full cycle of data analysis ‚Äî from importing raw data to generating insights and visuals for storytelling.

## üß™ SQL Executions & Tasks

```
Insight: Store A generates 30% more revenue than Store B, especially in the electronics category.

- 4. üë• Average Order Value per Customer
sql
 ```
SELECT
    CustomerID,
    ROUND(AVG(Sales), 2) AS AvgOrderValue
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY AvgOrderValue DESC;
```
Insight: The top 10% of customers spend more than 3x the average, indicating potential for loyalty programs.

## üìå Key Business Insights

- Electronics is the top-performing category overall.

- December sees the highest monthly sales, while January is the lowest.

- Store A consistently outperforms Store B, except in Books category.

- High-spending customers represent a small segment but drive a large portion of revenue.

## üìà Dashboard

- Visualizations were created using Python to show:

- Sales trends over time
